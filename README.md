## Overview  

Urban street vendors and small businesses often face:  
- High procurement costs due to small-scale buying  
- Unreliable suppliers and inconsistent quality  
- Limited bargaining power in fragmented markets  

Suppliers also face issues such as:
- Fragmented Demand
- Low Market Visibility
- Unreliable Payments & Logistics

**BoliBazaar** addresses these issues by:

## Key Features  

### ‚úÖ Verified Suppliers  
Suppliers undergo strict verification before being allowed to sell:  
- Business legitimacy (GST, registration compliance)  
- Product quality standards  
- Delivery reliability and on-time performance  
- Vendor ratings and reviews  

**Benefit:** Reduces risk, ensures trust, and strengthens supply chain reliability.  

---

### üîç Transparent Bidding  
When collectives place bulk orders, suppliers openly compete. Vendors can view:  
- All participating suppliers  
- Pricing offers  
- Delivery timelines and guarantees  

**Benefit:** Eliminates middlemen, reduces hidden costs, and gives even the smallest vendor fair access to competitive pricing.  

---

### üåç Localized Operations  
Vendors are grouped by geographic proximity, encouraging suppliers to deliver within zones.  
- Reduced transportation costs  
- Faster delivery for perishable goods  
- Simplified logistics and coordination  

**Benefit:** Supports efficient, sustainable urban commerce while reducing waste and delays.

## How It Works  

1. **Form Local Collectives**  
   Vendors in the same area collaborate to act as one large buyer.  
   *Example: Ten vendors in Chandni Chowk pool requirements into one consolidated order.*  

2. **Create Bulk Orders**  
   The system aggregates vendor needs (vegetables, spices, oils, packaging, etc.) into a combined request.  

3. **Suppliers Compete**  
   Verified suppliers are notified and submit competitive bids visible to all vendors.  

4. **Select the Best Deal**  
   The collective secures the supplier based on price, reliability, and reputation.  

**Result:** Vendors save money, gain transparency, and ensure dependable delivery.
